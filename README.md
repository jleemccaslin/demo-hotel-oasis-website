# Demo Next.js Hotel Customer Website
A website made with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Supabase where guests of a theoretical hotel can look at cabins, login, make bookings, manage their upcoming reservations, and update their profile data. Once created, guest and booking data is fed into a Supabase database where it is also read and managed by the React/TypeScript hotel employee application [here](https://github.com/jleemccaslin/demo-hotel-oasis-app).
